# Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk
## Introduction
This project is based on the following Kaggle competition: Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/overview.

The initial dataset comprises estimates of obesity levels among individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, aged between 14 and 61. These individuals exhibit diverse 
eating habits and physical conditions. Data collection was conducted via a web-based survey platform, where anonymous participants responded to various questions. 
The collected information was then processed, resulting in 17 attributes and 2111 records.

For this competition, both the training and testing datasets were generated using a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk dataset.
